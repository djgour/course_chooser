# Course Chooser

This was my project for the summer of 2014. It’s an app that allows you to plot out the courses to take towards a degree (namely, the Master of Information degree at the University of Toronto). A user can create multiple course plans to compare different options.

It was largely done as an exercise to learn about Ruby on Rails and, more generally, how web apps work, beyond just following along with a tutorial (though I made use of the [Hartl tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org) when I could).

The other objective was to actually create a tool to help me figure out what courses I should take, and I’m proud to say it did just that! It was actually pretty useful to me this past September. (For copyright reasons, however, I stripped the CSV file containing the University’s course descriptions from the GitHub repository.) 

### Some caveats:
As a learning/experimental project, the code is definitely not the most elegant or optimized. It also fell by the wayside once school, work and my volunteer activities picked up in the fall. And while I tried to stick to test-driven design, I definitely need to do some more research into how to choose and implement unit testing frameworks before I start on my 2015 summer project. Also, a lot more wireframing next time around.

But we all start somewhere, right? (And at least this way, you’ll know it’s not all just talk when I say I’m interested in Ruby and Rails and the nuts and bolts of web apps.)
