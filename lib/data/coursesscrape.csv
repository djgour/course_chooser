BKS1002H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/bks1002h|Book History in Practice|"Offered in the Winter Term and required of all master's students in the BHPC Program, this seminar is a continuation of BKS1001HF. The approach of the course reflects what David Greetham calls ""the disciplinary interrelatedness of all aspects of the study of the book"" (Textual Scholarship 2). The course consists of seminars on key topics in book history, punctuated by case studies of particular books, events, and debates. These case studies are designed to pull together ongoing threads of inquiry from the readings, and to allow students to work outward from specific artifacts to general questions. 
Enrolment normally limited to master's students registered in the BHPC Program.

C&T1006H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/ct1006h|Mind, Media and Society 1|"The object of this course is to examine the effects of communication media on psychological and social processes. In keeping with McLuhan's notion that ""the medium is the message"", the study of media should invite considerations about how people and institutions are affected by the specific technical, economic and social features of media, especially those that involve mind and language. We will begin to acquaint students with readings and methods with a review of some of McLuhan's basic themes and then explore theoretical and historical approaches to the associations of language, mind and media, from the earlier oral communities to the latest network societies. We will see how the alphabet affected our visual processing abilities and created the need for perspective and theatre directly through the reading process, and why the Internet is the principal cognitive figure of language processed by electricity. This will lead to the study of ""psycho-technologies"", that is technologies that spring from or to the mind, and of the ""psychodynamics"" these technologies provoke and develop. Technopsychology can also be applied for a close study of how networks, the web and the Internet affect social and personal interactions.
Note for winter 2013:  This will be the last time this course is offered in its present form.[*]   The emphasis will be on the “review of some of McLuhan's basic themes,” through a careful reading of McLuhan’s major works (especially the earlier ones), coupled with an analysis of their content, impact, and lasting value.  Secondary literature will be examined, as part of an exploration of the influence of McLuhan’s work on the emergence of the Internet and social media.  In a sense, this last offering will be taken as an opportunity to take stock of the content and overall significance of McLuhan's contribution.
*In 2013-14, C&T1006 is expected to be replaced by “INF1501H: Culture and Technology I"", as part of the launch of the new Culture and Technology concentration.

INF2124H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/inf2124h|Surveillance and Identity|"Following Foucault and others, we can think of surveillance as a discursive technique which produces knowledge and identities. Surveillance infrastructures infiltrate and mediate everyday life. For example, internet “cookies,” shopping loyalty cards, and mobile phone numbers all individuate and identify us. These identifiers are used to index databases recording our web surfing activities, our movements, and our purchases.
The databases are subjected to statistical analysis in order to produce knowledge of demographic categories, typical patterns, or suspect behavior. This knowledge is then applied back to individuals in the population in order to assign each to a particular niche market or risk group, and to act toward them accordingly. Thus, through surveillance, knowledge is created, categories and types are produced, and individuals are made visible as representatives of those types. This course investigates the technical, social, and legal contexts and implications of these practices.

Students will examine the complex interplay between children’s texts and artifacts, particularly as it relates to the concurrent rise of transmedia intertextuality and commercialization within children’s culture. They will learn about the key issues, institutions and “cultural gatekeepers” (including librarians) involved in the production, circulation and management of adult-produced texts and artifacts for children, and the ways in which children in turn engage with these texts and artifacts as part of a deeply meaningful shared cultural experience. A variety of examples and case studies will be examined, through in-class analysis and discussion of foundational children’s books, films, television series, toys, video games and digital applications. Recurring motifs, narrative themes and genres will be addressed. Special emphasis will be placed on understanding the continuities and discontinuities that exist between new and traditional cultural forms.
Students will also be invited to consider the unique set of opportunities and challenges associated with digital technologies, and how they are currently (re)shaping children’s culture in potentially significant ways.

Visible language (writing and reading) has been transformational not only for how we communicate and preserve ideas but also for how we think. However, as a literate people we have difficulty imagining both the powerful oral cultures that preceded us (and still exist) as well as the possibility of something beyond literacy.
This course will explore the nature of oral cultures, the transformations enabled by literacy, and speculate about the concept of rich human communication beyond traditional literacy (i.e. post literacy) that might evolve from advances in computing, biotechnology, or other, as yet unimagined, developments.
Using WordPress, and other open source tools and services, the instructor and the students will explore the idea of post literacy and engage in the network-mediated realm of digital scholarship by creating, authoring, and curating a publicly available digital publication."
INF2303H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/inf2303h-0|Special Topics: Understanding Open Source Software|"The course will explore the production of free / open source software (“F/OSS”) — that is, software that users are allowed to modify and redistribute without paying royalties. In the recent years such software has grown in prominence. Today it includes both popular end-user software such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, as well as back-end software that today dominates in many domains of IT infrastructure (e.g., the Apache web-server and the GNU/Linux operating system). Availability of such software presents both opportunities and challenges to today’s IT professionals.
The course will help students make better use and policy decisions in regards to F/OSS, looking at it from economic, cultural, political, organizational, and technical perspectives. Some of the investigated questions will include: history of F/OSS, economics and costs of F/OSS, reasons for participation, F/OSS as a social movement, politics of F/OSS, technical infrastructure used by F/OSS projects. The course will also look at the applicability of F/OSS model to other types of information products. The course will operate as a seminar.

This course will investigate the nature of services, the need for interdisciplinary approaches to services innovation, and the technology and tools needed to grow services innovation. Students will review several papers, engage in discussions, facilitate case studies, complete assignments (including use of business modeling tools), and write a final paper.
Through all of these mechanisms, students will investigate and study 1) the need for services innovation and services science, 2) current research directions in services science, and 3) technologies needed to support innovation in services."
INF2311H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/inf2311h|Managing AudioVisual Material|"The purpose and content of this course is to provide an introduction to the world of audiovisual documents (photographs, sound recordings, moving images). This includes their history, physical makeup, stages of creation, appraisal, acquisition, arrangement and description and preservation. As well there will be a brief introduction to copyright as well as the licensing and distribution ramifications of using, exhibiting, and re-purposing AV documents. By focusing on the above knowledge set, the course will reveal how important they are in research terms both as an adjunct to other types of documents and in their own right. This exposure will make it evident that audiovisual documents deserve to be given the fullest consideration in archival and library management decision-making, as much as any other types of documents.
There will also be an examination and critical review of examples of specialized audiovisual scholarship in the form of virtual exhibitions, illustrated and multiple-media books, DVD and CD box sets. The skills and knowledge to be taken away by the student include both the theoretical knowledge described above, as well as hands-on experience working with and assessing an actual audiovisual archival collection.

INF2312H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/inf2312h|Art Librarianship in Theory and Practice|"Art and design research has been revitalized by the revisionist impulse of visual culture analysis, which seeks to embed creativity within sociological and historical contexts. In response, art librarians must empower users to explore inter-disciplinary search tools that explore traditional aesthetic literature in relation to cultural studies.
Using case-studies to replicate practical experience with reference interactions, students will develop an understanding of how the new artistic environment informs all aspects of art librarianship from reference and instruction, to collection development and cataloguing. Issues of peer-review, artistic freedom, censorship, and intellectual property will be explored in relation to their impact on creative and intellectual production in the art and design environment.
Models of art and design libraries, archives, and museums will be analyzed in their differing roles in supporting creative activity.

INF2320H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/inf2320h|Remix Culture|"In this course, we will approach remix culture from many perspectives: as a genre, as an aesthetic, as an analytic framework, as a set of existing practices, and as a sort of cultural movement.
We will examine core concepts, theories and practices involved in remix culture(s), focusing on the ways in which these practices implicate issues and questions that are central to developing a better understanding of the information society: from the alleged rise of piracy and plagiarism in the digital age, to growing concerns about the enclosure of the commons, to enduring hopes about the potential democratization of cultural production and distribution. The course design revolves heavily around experiential learning.
Students in this course will take part in a collaborative “remixing” of the syllabus, determining the order in which the weekly topics will be examined, and thereby having a significant impact on their own learning trajectories and how themes are paired and juxtaposed within lectures and class discussions.

INF2330H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/inf2330h|Information Ethnography|"The course focuses on identifying and understanding what is ""informational"" in any setting. Students will develop sharpened vision to discern informational patterns, that is, an ability to trace what Bates (1999) calls the ""red thread"" of information pervading life. To this end, the course involves a fusion of information theory and ethnographic method that is then applied by each student to an independent Research Project. Theories, models, and concepts will be introduced from the literature of Information Seeking and Use (ISU). Students will learn the fundamentals of ethnographic research. Featured Contexts will be profiled and considered as exemplar information experiences in context. As the semester unfolds, students will refine their observational and analytical skills through an exploratory, ethnographic Research Project about the information experience within a context of personal interest or career relevance.

INF2331H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/inf2331h|The Future of the Book|"This course considers the history and possible futures of books in a digital world. In this course ""the book"" is interpreted broadly, meaning not just an object with covers and pages, but also an evolving metaphor for conceptual frameworks for knowledge, and a metonym that brings together many different technologies, institutions, and cultural practices. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary approaches such as book history, textual studies, history of reading, and digital humanities, with an emphasis on balancing theoretical speculation with practical implementation. Readings will survey topics such as the ontology of born-digital artifacts, critical assessment of digitization projects, collaborative knowledge work, reading devices (old and new), e-book interface design, text/image/multimedia relationships, theories and practices of markup, the gendering of technologies, the politics of digital archiving, the materiality of texts, and the epistemology of digital tools.

INF2332H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/inf2332h|Information Behaviour|"Information behaviour is the currently preferred term used to describe the many ways in which human beings interact with information, in particular the ways in which people seek and utilize information (Bates, 2010). An understanding of information behaviour is central to work in the information professions and knowledge-based industries. For more than 75 years information behaviour research has been conducted in the field of library and information studies.
This course is organized as two units to introduce students to information behaviour using contrasting pedagogical and epistemological strategies. Unit I: Foundations (sessions 1-5) surveys the history and major theories, models, and concepts of information behaviour, drawing from the library and information studies literature and its traditional cognitive paradigm. Building upon this platform, Unit II: Integrative Topics (sessions 6-12) approaches information behaviour within diverse contexts and from contemporary vantage points that are more holistic, social, and interdisciplinary.
The dual approaches to information behaviour caters to a diversity of student learning styles, interests, and aspirations and represent iSchool ideals; further, it generates the ability to both analyze and sensitively understand the human information experience.

The electric smart grid promises increased capacity, reliability and efficiency through the marriage of cyber technology with the existing electricity network. This integration, however, creates a new host of vulnerabilities stemming from cyber or physical intrusion potentially leading to devastating physical effects. The security of a system is as strong as its weakest link. Thus, the scale and complexity of the smart grid, along with its increased connectivity and automation make the task of cyber-physical protection particularly challenging. This course introduces students to timely topics in security and privacy of modern power systems. After an introduction to common communications security practices and select basics of power systems, the unique communication and computational protection needs of the emerging smart grid are characterized. Timely cyber-physical security and privacy solutions based on research papers and technical reports are surveyed.

MSL2000H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/msl2000h|Curatorial Practice|"The classic tasks of curators focus on advancing cultural, artistic, historical, and scientific understanding, and then making it accessible to scholars and to the public through exhibits and other media, typically in a collections-centred environment. Hand-in-hand with this work, curators enhance museum collections, most notably by choosing items to acquire and selecting materials to deaccession. They also contribute their expertise in the wider operations of museums and galleries, typically at a senior level. Beyond these long-standing functions, curators serve as facilitators for other people to study museum resources and communicate their findings to the public. Building on themes introduced in ""Introduction to Museology and Public History"" of central importance to these endeavours, ""Curatorial Practice"" explores those functions and related topics, both at a theoretical level and as they play out in today's contested museum and gallery worlds."

Furthermore, the history of modern science is tied to the history of museums and in many ways public displays of science have influenced the development of science itself. Yet few museum professionals speak and understand the language of science. With a view to satisfying the basic requirements of any museum professional, this course will introduce the student to the fundamentals of scientific thinking and to the key issues associated with curating science subject matter. Specific examples of science-based museum displays and exhibitions will be explored in an engaging series of lectures, workshops, excursions and conversations with museum professionals.
The student will come away with the tools needed to engage with the subject of science and museums at an advanced professional level.

The course investigates various attempts to define, locate, justify and build a set of rules and/or sentiments from which the interpretation of the ""texts""? of the world could proceed—be they written, visual, social or ideological. Specifically, we will look at the allegorical impulses of medieval textual interpretations, the reasoned truths of the enlightenment, the passions and authorial empathy of the nineteenth-century romantics, the structural empiricism of the early these, we will find and face the meaning-making practices that both haunt and inform contemporary acts of interpretation."
MSL2331H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/msl2331h|Exhibitions, Interpretation, Communication|"This course explores the three main areas which make up a museum’s public programming strategies – exhibitions, interpretation and communication. For each area, we will look into the theories which shaped it, the histories which inform it and the practices developed by museums and other ""cultural"" institutions, from department stores to amusement parks. The course discusses critically different regimes of public display from the 18th century to the present, focusing on forms of representation and corresponding categories of knowledge. It traces the changes in public programming and education from object pedagogies to strategies which include all aspects of the sensorium, from sight to taste. Finally, the course maps out changes in communication, branding and advertising practices as influenced by the rise of the culture industries and new media technologies."
MSL2332H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/msl2332h|Public Programs and Education|"This course examines the theoretical roots, the ideological positions and the research literature on public programming and education strategies deployed in museums, parks, libraries, and heritage institutions. The course offers a critique of models of schooling, experience, citizenship and critical engagement that dominate current discourse and practices.

Students also study the role of collective bargaining agreements negotiated in the not-for-profit sector and engage in simulated negotiating sessions, as well as prepare a detailed plan for a project of their choice. Other topics covered include leadership and motivation.
MSL2360H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/msl2360h|Museums and Indigenous Communities: Changing Relations, Changing Practice|"This course explores the changing relationships between aboriginal source communities and museums holding their material heritage. We begin with a historical overview of collecting practices, the role of indigenous material culture in the development of museums, and the relationship between museums and colonialism. Contemporary case studies primarily drawn from post-colonial and settler contexts during the last three decades are investigated as a response to earlier practices.
Students are challenged to use these case studies in order to interrogate ideas of the museum as a ‘contact zone’, the shifting meaning of objects, contemporary curatorial challenges, the potential of new museum practices, and source community expectations. Actual exhibitions, repatriation requests and museological dilemmas are used to engage critically with theoretical developments in material culture studies, material anthropology, art history, and indigenous studies.

Museums, memorials, national parks and historic sites, among other examples of cultural heritage, will be examined in light of philosophical issues and evolving political, social, economic and cultural contexts.
MSL2500H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/msl2500h|Constructing and Curating Digital Heritage|"The impact of digital technology is increasingly visible in almost all fields of contemporary museum and cultural heritage practice. Digitization of cultural heritage collections, both within and outside museums, as well as the emergence of “born digital” cultural information on the Web, establish digital heritage as a new field of theory and practice, laden with new problems and opportunities, and introducing new issues and agendas related to the digital curation of cultural information. To elucidate these phenomena, this course introduces museum documentation and digital collection theory and practice through a historical examination of museum collections, cataloguing practices, as well as wider traditions on constructing and managing cultural information; it explores how information technologies change the role of museums and cultural heritage institutions as sites for curatorship, as infrastructures for scholarly research, and as memory institutions – guardians of authenticity and intellectual preservation of the past; finally, it examines critically how interactivity and narrative, virtual and augmented reality, social media, user-generated content, linked data and ontologies produce new challenges and opportunities for cultural memory, digital curation and meaning-making.
Students taking this course will be expected to develop a critical understanding of the concepts, issues and methodological approaches relevant to the construction and curation of digital cultural heritage collections, based on a combination of theoretical and applied work.

MSL3000Y|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/msl3000y|Internship|"The internship, taken between the first and second year of enrolment, is a 12-week placement in a recognised museum, gallery or related institution. The goal of the internship is the development of competence in the practice of museum studies. It is an integral part of the curriculum, intended to reinforce knowledge gained in first-year course work and to apply it to museum situations. Each placement is designed to meet the individual student's needs in relation to career goals and interests. Previous internships have been arranged in institutions and organisations throughout Canada, the US and abroad.
Specific times for MSL3000Y in the Winter term to be confirmed in September."
MSL4000Y|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/msl4000y|Exhibition Project|In this course a cohort of students in the second year of their program work together throughout the fall and spring terms to prepare one or more exhibitions. The exhibition(s) will take place at the end of the second year at various University sites or in conjunction with local museums. Whereas, Museum Studies staff and the respective museum staff establish the exhibit's parameters, students are involved in all aspects of its development. Exhibition projects must be approved by the Director and the Program Committee.
MSL5050H|http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/course-descriptions/msl5050h|Special Studies|"In this course students undertake a directed study of a museum related application that cannot be met by the present complement of elective courses. Topics may relate to any aspect of museum operation or function.
Museum Studies students, as well as students outside of the Museum Studies who wish to apply their particular field of study to a specific issue in Museum Studies, should discuss the topic with a potential supervisor. Approval is subject to department guidelines and procedures, as well as the availability of a supervisor.
In order to be considered an elective credit, the work in this course cannot significantly overlap the content of other courses in the Master of Museum Studies program. Students must submit the SGS form Request for Reading and/or Research Course."
